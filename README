This project has the goal to give a concrete example on how to use the **Aviary Android SDK**.

Before download this project make sure to download the Aviary SDK: https://github.com/AviaryInc/Mobile-Feather-SDK-for-Android.

=== CHANGES IN VERSION 100 ===
We drop the support to the Android API Level 8, this means that now the minimum android version supported is the 2.3.x ( API Level 9 ).
A complete new UI, all the previous styles.xml, theme.xml and all the others xml files in the res/values/ folder were renamed.
A complete new theme has been created too, the FeatherActivity now must have the "AviaryTheme" associated in the AndroidManifest.xml


=== CHANGES IN VERSION 82 ===

The old FeatherSystemReceiver has been moved and renamed. 
Now it's `com.aviary.android.feather.library.receivers.AviarySystemReceiver`. You need to update your AndroidManifest.xml


=== IMPORTANT CHANGE IN VERSION 74 ===

The way the API-KEY is passed to the FeatherActivity has changed.
You don't have to pass it through the calling Intent anymore.
Now you must save your api-key content inside the file called "aviary-credentials.txt"
placed inside your "assets" folder.

Be sure to update your application accoring to this change, next versions of the Aviary SDK
will throw an error if this file cannot be found or the api-key is not valid.

Grab your api key from http://aviary.com/android
